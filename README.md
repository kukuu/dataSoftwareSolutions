## Our Integration Patterns

- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA): This focuses on production detection, consumption and reaction of Events. Systems communicate through events, allowing for decoupled and scalable architectures.

Technologies: Apache Kafka, AWS Event Bridge and NATS Streaming.

- Microservices Integration: This architecture involves breaking down applications into small independently deployable components and services. Integration Patterns for Microservices include API Gateways, Service Meshes and Event-driven communication.

Technologies: Istio (Service Nesh), Linkerd, Envoy Proxy.

- GraphQL for API Integration: GraphQL is a query language for APis that allows clients to request data they only need. It simplifies API Integration by providing flexible and efficient way to interact with data.

Technologies: Apollo Server, HASURA, and GraphQL subscriptions.

- Severless Integration: Our Severless computing infrastructure allows developers to build and run applications without managing server infrastructure. It is often used for event-driven and small focused functions.

Technologies: AWS Lambda, AZURE Functions, Google Cloud Functions.

- API Management & Gateway Solutions: Used to optimise, manage and secure API calls. They also play key roles in access controls, monitoring and ensuring the performance of API calls.

Technologies: Kong, Ambassador, and Traefik.
